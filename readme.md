# My Application

> Author: Brandtley McMinn


## Requirements

```
Node: v5.0.0+
cURL: 7.40.x+
```


### For Windows users:

**_NOTE_: Windows users should install cURL if you don't already have it in your system path.**

If you are unsure you have cURL installed on your machine, enter the command `curl --help` into your terminal app of choice and see if it lists all available cURL commands or errors out.

To install, just download the `.zip` file for your Windows flavor from the following URL, and add the resulting `curl.dll` file to a folder that exists in your `PATH` environment.

## Getting started

```bash
# run the following scripts in order
npm i
npm run bootstrap
npm run watch

# start the local client server by opening a seperate console instance
# and running the following command...
npm run serve
```


Now you can open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


## Environment configs

Certain aspects of the application and local server can be tweaked using the `.env` config generated by the `npm run bootstrap` process.
